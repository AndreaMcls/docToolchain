== Demo-Doc

This file is to demonstrate some features which are not available in the docs.

=== mark missing alt tags

A little CSS-Style can mark all images without `alt`-tag as blurred:

[source,css]
----
img:not([alt]) {
  filter: blur(5px) !important;
}
----

++++
<style>
img:not([alt]) {
  filter: blur(5px) !important;
}
</style>
++++

=== Mindmaps

this feature needs a newer version of the AsciiDoc-Diagram plugin.
